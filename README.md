# Iris Image Database

This repository contains my Kaggle notebook dedicated to the analysis of a dataset composed of iris flower images.  
The goal of this project is to apply computer vision and data analysis techniques to extract meaningful patterns and insights from the images.

The workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing image data
  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  
- Visualization of image features and class distributions
  
- Application of machine learning models (if applicable)
  
- Interpretation of results and performance metrics

This project is a hands-on exploration of image datasets, combining both visual understanding and analytical approaches.  
Feel free to explore the notebook, suggest improvements, or fork it for your own experiments!


The CASIA-Iris-Interval dataset is a subset of the CASIA Iris Image Database (CASIA-IrisV4), developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Automation (CASIA). This dataset comprises high-quality grayscale images of iris patterns, captured using a specialized close-up iris camera equipped with a circular near-infrared (NIR) LED array to ensure clear imaging. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate research in iris recognition, particularly focusing on the detailed texture features of iris images. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Dataset Details
Number of Images: The CASIA-Iris-Interval subset contains 2,639 iris images from 395 classes (individual eyes). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
